## Subsetting in data.frames    
Write the code bellow to generate the datasets.
Then go throught the questions in a specific R script to save the results. You'll find the solutions in the campus as well.



```{r nutshell, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages('nutshell') no need if its already instaled
# library(nutshell) # package calling always needed
# data(batting.2008)
# str(batting.2008)
# head(batting.2008)

```

> 1. Check if there's NAs in the dataframe 

> 2. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1980

> 3. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1980 and who bats with boths arms (B in bats)

> 4. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1980 and who bats with boths arms (B in bats) but throws with only left arm (L in trows)

> 5. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players belonging to teams OAK or DET

> 6. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1985, but only keeping variables nameLast, nameFirst, birthYear and teamID

> 7. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1985 or with a height not greater than 71, but only keeping variables nameLast, nameFirst, birthYear, height and teamID

> 8. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1985 or with a height not greater than 71, but keeping all variables except teamID

> 9. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1985 or with a height not greater than 71, but keeping all variables except teamID and nameLast

> 10. Filter the dataframe, keeping only players born after 1985 or before 1965 and with a height not greater than 71 or at least 90, keeping only variables nameLast, nameFirst, birthYear and height. Assign it to a new dataframe (batting_2)

> 11. Create a new variable at the begining of the batting_2 being a sequence from one to the number of rows in batting_2, and name it id_row. Then eliminate it
