## Merging data.frames    
Write the code bellow to generate the datasets.
Then go throught the questions in a specific R script to save the results. You'll find the solutions in the campus as well.



```{r nutshell, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages('nutshell') no need if its already instaled
# library(nutshell) # package calling always needed 

# load the medicare.payments.by.state data set from nutshell library
data(medicare.payments.by.state)

# read df_state.csv (in the campus, from previous session)
df_state<-read.csv('df_states.csv',sep=';')
```

> 1. Name medicare.payments.by.state as df_medicare; check both dataframes structure 

> 2. Filter df_medicare de-duplicating the States and assign it to df_medicare_unique.
    + Check the levels of the State factor variable and compare with those of id variable in df_state

> 3. Drop the variables Diagnosis.Related.Group and Footnote and the rows for States NY and CA from df_medicare_unique, and assign it to 
df_medicare_unique_truncated

> 4. Create an inner join between df_medicare_unique_truncated and df_state, keeping only states that match, assign it to df_inner_join and analyze the result

> 5. Create a left join, keeping all states from df_medicare_unique_truncated (but not necessarily from df_states), and assign it to df_left_join_1>

> 6. Create a left join, keeping all states from df_state (but not necessarily from df_medicare_unique_truncated), and assign it to df_left_join_2

> 7. Create an outer join, keeping all states from df_state and from df_medicare_unique_truncated, and assign it to df_outer_join

> 8. Create variable z in df_state filled with random letters A,B,C,U,V,W and variable z in df_medicare_unique with random letters A,B,C,D,E,F.
    + Crate a data set from a merge between df_state and df_medicare_unique where you keep only states that match in both data frames by state abbreviation and with the same value for the z variable
